Assumptions: 
1. The instances are fixed (if you need to change this check out wizcard/instances.py
2. the environment is one of "dev" or "test", its easy to add more env to settings.
3. git account is setup (talk to me for password details) or feel free to add your private key to the aws instance
4. req.txt is uptodate with packages needed
5. settings.py has necessary information for DB instance.

Known issues:

1. Nginx and upstart scripts are in git specific to instances, if you need to add more instances or change instances need to edit the getwizcard file with the hostnames
2. memcached still requires manual work to start on the hostname rather than localhost.
3. Security groups are preconfigured, if you want your host to talk to aws instances - whitelist in security group.

QUICK READ:

1. If you have existing instances which just needs code update and restart, all you need to do is run 

./deploy.sh updaterestart

NOTE: git password prompt will require input

2. If you want to update packages and restart, 
./deploy.sh deploy 

NOTE: please ensure that the req.txt is in git with the packages that needs update.

DETAILS:

If you want anything else, you can run the fabric commands with appropriate commands - 

fab -f fabfile.py help 

lists all commands available.
